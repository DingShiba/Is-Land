        textArea:"The ama/haenyeo culture was once widely distributed in the coastal areas of Asia. Amas are brimming with vitality and vigor, representing a highly distinctive feminine power flourishing in East Asia. They make their living from the sea, serving as the most skilled oceanic hunters. Adhering strictly to and revering the rules of nature, they are the scattered marine spirits in the earthly realm. The ama culture can be traced back several thousand years, yet it seems to be on the verge of extinction. This piece focuses attention on the plight of the ama, taking the ama and their hunting tools as the focal points of design, embracing the concepts of \"balance\" and \"buoyancy,\" providing a new interpretation for this ancient yet dwindling traditional way of life.",

        left2:"The \"ama\" refers to professional women who typically do not wear breathing apparatus, diving to the seabed to capture valuable benthic marine organisms for a living. They are hunters of the seabed, capturing marine life such as lobsters, abalones, sea urchins, and octopuses. The ama have existed in coastal areas of East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and other Asian regions. In the coastal areas of Japan and South Korea, the footprints of ama have been widely distributed, constructing a unique culture. However, with the development of mechanical fishing and artificial aquaculture techniques, the number of ama has significantly decreased.",

            describe1:"Eking out a living from the ocean has never been an easy task. The underwater environment is exceedingly intricate. Ama not only have to guard against potential attacks, but also maneuver carefully amidst sharp underwater rocks and resilient sea grass. A highly skilled ama requires more than just adept water skills acquired from extensive training; she also needs to be resolute and meticulous.",
            describe2:"Even for a highly skilled ama, it is difficult to completely guard against tragedies caused by clothing or tools getting caught on rocks, leading to fatal entrapment. Hence, in ancient times, ama often dived naked or simply wore thin garments when working. In the modern era, form-fitting silicone wetsuits have provided ama with comprehensive protection, enabling them to work more effectively and confidently in the water.",
            describe3:"As a traditional primary industry, the tools used by the ama are neither numerous nor complex. In addition to a well-fitting wetsuit, they require a set of adept tools to pry the robust muscles of the mollusks, as well as a highly visible \"buoyancy system\" from the sea surface.",
            fixed1:"The so-called \"buoyancy system\" generally consists of a float on the water surface and a net with storage functionality. Some ama directly use a sturdy, oversized wooden barrel to serve both functions.",
            fixed2:"During work, this \"system\" quietly drifts on the sea, firmly tethered to the ama by a robust safety rope, as the ama tirelessly shuttles between the seabed and her watery \"island\". Day after day of ebb and flow, the ama earns for herself status and prosperity."

            describe:"This series originates from the designer's observations of the balance between the ama and the buoyancy system, integrating the concepts of \"buoyancy\" and \"symbiosis\" into the design. The work focuses on the current situation of the ama, offering a new interpretation of this ancient yet fading traditional way of life."
