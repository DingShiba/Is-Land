        textArea:"The ama/haenyeo culture was once widely distributed in the coastal areas of Asia. Amas are brimming with vitality and vigor, representing a highly distinctive feminine power flourishing in East Asia. They make their living from the sea, serving as the most skilled oceanic hunters. Adhering strictly to and revering the rules of nature, they are the scattered marine spirits in the earthly realm. The ama culture can be traced back several thousand years, yet it seems to be on the verge of extinction. This piece focuses attention on the plight of the ama, taking the ama and their hunting tools as the focal points of design, embracing the concepts of \"balance\" and \"buoyancy,\" providing a new interpretation for this ancient yet dwindling traditional way of life.",

        left2:"The \"ama\" refers to professional women who typically do not wear breathing apparatus, diving to the seabed to capture valuable benthic marine organisms for a living. They are hunters of the seabed, capturing marine life such as lobsters, abalones, sea urchins, and octopuses. The ama have existed in coastal areas of East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and other Asian regions. In the coastal areas of Japan and South Korea, the footprints of ama have been widely distributed, constructing a unique culture. However, with the development of mechanical fishing and artificial aquaculture techniques, the number of ama has significantly decreased.",

            describe1:"Eking out a living from the ocean has never been an easy task. The underwater environment is exceedingly intricate. Ama not only have to guard against potential attacks, but also maneuver carefully amidst sharp underwater rocks and resilient sea grass. A highly skilled ama requires more than just adept water skills acquired from extensive training; she also needs to be resolute and meticulous.",
            describe2:"Even for a highly skilled ama, it is difficult to completely guard against tragedies caused by clothing or tools getting caught on rocks, leading to fatal entrapment. Hence, in ancient times, ama often dived naked or simply wore thin garments when working. In the modern era, form-fitting silicone wetsuits have provided ama with comprehensive protection, enabling them to work more effectively and confidently in the water.",
            describe3:"As a traditional primary industry, the tools used by the ama are neither numerous nor complex. In addition to a well-fitting wetsuit, they require a set of adept tools to pry the robust muscles of the mollusks, as well as a highly visible \"buoyancy system\" from the sea surface.",
            fixed1:"The so-called \"buoyancy system\" generally consists of a float on the water surface and a net with storage functionality. Some ama directly use a sturdy, oversized wooden barrel to serve both functions.",
            fixed2:"During work, this \"system\" quietly drifts on the sea, firmly tethered to the ama by a robust safety rope, as the ama tirelessly shuttles between the seabed and her watery \"island\". Day after day of ebb and flow, the ama earns for herself status and prosperity."

            describe:"This series originates from the designer's observations of the balance between the ama and the buoyancy system, integrating the concepts of \"buoyancy\" and \"symbiosis\" into the design. The work focuses on the current situation of the ama, offering a new interpretation of this ancient yet fading traditional way of life."

        describe1:"The traditional hunting practices of the ama determine that they are engaged in one of the most ocean-friendly professions. To prevent overfishing, the ama strictly adhere to regulations regarding underwater hunting and refrain from capturing immature marine life.",
        describe2:"This harmonious way of life alongside the ocean may have continued for thousands of years, but it remains challenging to pinpoint the specific origins of the ama, especially when it comes to determining the professionalization of their occupation.",
        describe3:"The distinct gender orientation of the ama profession has different theories about its origins. One widely accepted explanation is that, due to women's generally inherent meticulousness and higher subcutaneous fat content, they were more suitable for diving operations before the application of advanced diving suits. It's also suggested that prolonged historical wars led to a decrease in male labor force, causing women to gradually take on more production work. Additionally, ancient Korea once implemented an unfair tax system, resulting in heavier taxes for male labor, thus making it more of a burden for men to work outside the home. Each of these arguments has its merits, and it is difficult to determine which factor is decisive. Nonetheless, over time, the unique professional identity of \"ama\" emerged in the coastal regions of Asia.",

The designer aimed for these sections to serve as focal points, providing a visually striking \"floating\" sensation and forming a visual equilibrium with the rest of the garment as a whole.",
            describe2:"After chronic testing, a commonly used aluminum-plated film, often employed for food packaging, was ultimately chosen. This composite aluminum film, more flexible and resilient than typical aluminum film, exhibits significant tear resistance. It allows for sealing using a small electric iron with cotton cloth, offering excellent airtightness. This material is also compatible with UV printing, resulting in a matte texture with a granular appearance after coloring. Injecting helium into the aluminum foil enhances its buoyancy, giving it even the ability to truly float."

            describe1:"Many ama suffer from various occupational diseases, commonly affecting the waist, legs, or the cardiopulmonary region. Nevertheless, the honed physique developed over the years also contributes to the ama's longer life expectancy compared to the average person. Ama culture emphasizes an independent and strong female spirit, praising friendships among women, thus fostering a strong sense of community.",
            describe2:"The ama fear neither winds and waves nor fierce beasts, nor do they fear invaders. Since 1932, the ama of Jeju Island in South Korea have led hundreds of struggles against Japanese colonial aggression, constituting the largest female-led anti-Japanese salvation movement in Korean history. Subsequently, at the starting point of this movement, the South Korean government constructed the Ama Resistance Memorial Park and Ama Museum at 3204-1, Old Joe-ri, Geumdo-myeon, Jeju Island, to commemorate the resistance of the ama against Japanese colonialism."

Astronaut Buzz Aldrin described it as \"magnificent desolation.\" As astronauts worked outside the spacecraft, a short tether connected them to the space station. They floated in the darkness, surrounded by a profound silence.",
        describe2:"And back on Earth, one of the most relatable figures to astronauts is probably the ama. In the ebb and flow of the ocean waves, the only companions for the ama are their small buoys.",
        describe3:"Viewed from the water's surface, the world appears divided by color, becoming deceptively simple. The sight is composed solely of the sky's cerulean blue above and the ocean's azure blue below. The ama, tethered to their buoys, resemble an iceberg, with only a portion visible above the sea's surface, while the more crucial part extends deeply beneath the water. The ama shuttle back and forth between their \"island\" and the seabed, placing the precious marine harvest into their surface-level nets. If encountering any unforeseen circumstance in the sea, the ama can swiftly return along the direction of the safety rope. For the ama, the floating island on the sea's surface is the comforting land that puts their hearts at ease."
